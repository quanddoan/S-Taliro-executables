# S-Taliro-executables

This repository holds a modified version of https://github.com/lyudeyun/AI-CPS-Benchmark that allows RQ2 scripts to be compiled into executables using Simulink Compiler

Only _T_ models are available for compilation, since _RL_ models requires Reinforcement Learning Toolbox, which Simulink Compiler does not support.
So far, due to limitations of original soucecode, only 3 models have been compiled successfully: ACC, LKA, AFC
